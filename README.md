WoW AddOn - SkyMinimap

A simple "re-skin" of World of Warcraft's minimap. Since Skyrim doesn't offer a minimap and neither Elder Scrolls Online (there was one during Beta phase), I tried to make it as "Skyrim'ish" as possible.
I decided to create it because Minimap helps a lot, giving you information about your surroundings (e.g. Quests, Trainers, etc...). It also a place commonly used by addOns to store their buttons (also known as Minimap Buttons). Time is also another important information to take in mind.

It's very clean, just like all Skyrim UI, so it can also fit in others UIs. A tiny button can be clicked in order to access some functionalities, for example, Calendar and Tracking. This was added to make the Minimap cleaner.

###How to use it:
---

Everything is pretty much default besides the zoom. You need to use the mouse-wheel to zoom in/out.

The Minimap's side button can be pressed in order to access some Blizzard functionalities, for example: Calendar.

The Time Frame also shows the zone's name where you at currently. You can also left-click to switch and right-click to open Blizzard Time options.
